\textbf{The Burkholder-Davis-Gundy Inequality (BDG)}
Let $(M_t, \F_t), M_t = \int_0^t F_s \diff W_s$ with suitable integrable condition, be continuous local martingale. $\forall p \in [1, \infty), \exists c_p, C_p s.t.$
\begin{equation*}
   c_p \E\left( \int_0^T \norm{F_t}^2 \diff t \right)^\frac{p}{2} \leq \E\sup_{t\leq T} \abs{M_t}^p \leq C_p \E\left( \int_0^T \norm{F_t}^2 \diff t \right)^\frac{p}{2}.
\end{equation*}

\begin{rem}
$\E\left( \int_0^T \norm{F_t}^2 \diff t \right)^\frac{p}{2} = \infty$ is allowed.
\end{rem}
\textbf{Doob's inequality} Now we provide a simpler version, namely for $d=1$, we assume $\E\int_0^T F_t^2  \diff t < \infty$. Now we have martingale. Then
\begin{equation*}
    \E\sup_{t\leq T} \abs{M_t}^2 \leq 4\E M_T^2.
\end{equation*}

\textbf{Gronwall inequality} Let $f:[0,T] \rightarrow [0,\infty)$ with $\int_0^T f(t) \diff t < \infty$ Assume that $\exists a,b\geq 0$ s.t.
\begin{equation*}
    f(t) \leq a + b\int_0^t f(s) \diff s \quad t\leq T,
\end{equation*}
then,
\begin{equation*}
    f(t) \leq a e^{bt} \leq  C a,
\end{equation*}
with constant $C = e^{bT}$.

\begin{cor}
If $f \geq 0$ and
\begin{equation*}
    f(t) \leq a(t) + \int_0^t b(s) f(s) \diff s, t\geq 0,
\end{equation*} and $a$ is non-decreasing, then
\begin{equation*}
    f(t) \leq a(t) e^{\int_0^t b(s) \diff s}.
\end{equation*}
\end{cor}

\newpage
Here, I would like to provide a handbook for one can determine the existence and uniqueness of solutions of SDE in the form
\begin{equation*}
    \begin{cases}
        \diff X_t = F(t, X_t) \diff t + G(t, X_t) \diff W_t,  \\
        X_0 = x.
    \end{cases}
\end{equation*}
We could possibly talk about four types solutions globally strong, globally weak, locally strong and locally weak. This type of questions we have talked previously but now I give a handy tool in exam or for problem solving.

\noindent \textbf{Strong and Weak} From my point of view, weak solution is more flexible, we only care about the dynamics or distribution but not the exact probability space or Brownian motion. Strong solution is in some sense fixed.

\noindent \textbf{General requirements}
This is the part should be satisfied for all types of solutions.

\noindent \textbf{Global strong solution}
Given the probability space such that $(\Omega, \F, (\F_t)^W, \prob)$ and $(W_t, \F_t^W)$ is BM defined on $\Omega$ we say $X_t$ is a \textbf{Global Strong} solution to if
\begin{itemize}
    \item $X_t\in\F_t$ be adapted.
    \item Integrals are well defined
    \begin{equation*}
        \int_0^T \abs{F(t, X_t)} \diff t < \infty \quad \int_0^T \abs{G(t, X_t)}^2 \diff t < \infty \quad a.s.
    \end{equation*}
    \item Both $F, G$ being \textbf{Lipschitz},
\end{itemize}
and finally, 
\begin{equation*}
    X_t = x + \int_s^t F(r,X_r) \diff r+\int_s^t G(r,X_r) \diff W_r \quad a.s.
\end{equation*}

\noindent \textbf{Local Strong solution}

\begin{dfn}{\textbf{(Local Lipschitz)}}
We say $F$ and $G$ are locally Lipschitz if $\forall n \geq 1, \quad \exists l_n$ s.t.
\begin{equation*}
    \abs{x}\leq n, \abs{y}\leq n \implies \abs{F(x) - F(y)} \leq l_n \abs{x-y} \quad \abs{G(x) - G(y)} \leq l_n \abs{x-y}.
\end{equation*}
\end{dfn}

Given the probability space such that $(\Omega, \F, (\F_t)^W, \prob)$ and $(W_t, \F_t^W)$ is BM defined on $\Omega$ we say $X_t$ is a \textbf{Local strong} solution to if
\begin{itemize}
    \item $X_t\in\F_t$ be adapted.
    \item Both $F, G$ being \textbf{Local Lipschitz}.
    \item $\tau_n := \inf\{t \geq 0; \abs{X_t} \geq n\}$.
    \item Integrability condition is satisfied $\int_0^{t\wedge \tau_n} \left(\abs{F(X_s)}+\abs{G(X_s)}^2 \diff s \right) <\infty$ and
\begin{equation*}
    X_t = x_0 + \int_0^{t\wedge \tau_n} F(X_s) \diff s + \int_0^{t\wedge \tau_n} G(X_s) \diff s\quad a.s.
\end{equation*}
\end{itemize}
If we have linear growth rate, then we have global strong, that is $\tau = \infty$ a.s. Otherwise it is possible to have finite explosion time.

\noindent \textbf{Weak solution Global or Local}
\begin{dfn}
Weak solution of the SDE up to an explosion time $\tau$ consist of
\begin{itemize}
    \item $(\Omega, \F, \prob), (\F_t)$ satisfies usual conditions.
    \item $W_t \in \F_t$.
    \item $X_t$ a continuous adapted process taking value in \textbf{extended real line $[-\infty, \infty]$}. and $\abs{X_0} < \infty$ a.s.
    \item We define stopping time (boundedness) $\tau_n$ as 
    \begin{equation*}
        \tau_n := \inf\{t\geq0, \abs{X_t} \geq n\}.
    \end{equation*}
    \item integrability condition and solution representation
    \begin{align*}
        &\int_0^{t \wedge \tau_n} \left(\abs{F(X_s)} + \abs{G(X_s)}^2 \right)\diff s <\infty \\
        &X_t = X_0 + \int_0^{t \wedge \tau_n} F(X_s) \diff s + \int_0^{t \wedge \tau_n} G(X_s) \diff W_s \quad a.s.
    \end{align*}
\end{itemize}
\end{dfn}
If $\tau = \infty$ we say the solution is global. If $\tau <\infty$ we forbid the situation of alternating between $-\infty$ to $\infty$. We are not interested in the solution in this form.

\textbf{Existence and Uniqueness for Global Weak solution}
Assume that 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $G^2(x) > 0 \quad \forall x\in \R$.
    \item $\forall x \in \R, \exists \epsilon >0$ s.t. \begin{equation*}
        \int_{x-\epsilon}^{x+\epsilon} \frac{\abs{F(y)}}{G^2(y)} \diff y < \infty,  
    \end{equation*}
\end{enumerate}
and $\forall x \in \R, \exists \epsilon >0$ s.t.
\begin{equation*}
    \int_{x-\epsilon}^{x+\epsilon} \frac{1}{G^2(y)} \diff y = \infty.
\end{equation*}
Then there exists a unique non-exploding $\tau = \infty$ solution for every $X_0$.

\noindent Fix $c\in I$ (the interval $I = (l, r)$ is the interested range for particular problem)
\begin{itemize}
    \item Scale function
        \begin{equation*}
            p(x) = \int_c^x \exp\left(-2 \int_c^r \frac{F(z)}{G^2(z)} \diff z \right) \diff r.
        \end{equation*}
    \item Speed measure
        \begin{equation*}
            m(\diff x) = \frac{2}{p'(x) G^2(x)} \diff x.
        \end{equation*}
    \item The function $v$
        \begin{equation*}
            v(x) = \int_c^x (p(x)- p(y)) m(\diff y).
        \end{equation*}
\end{itemize}

\noindent \textbf{Gloal or Local}
Let $X_0 = x \in (l ,r)$ be \textit{deterministic} and let $\tau = \inf\{t\geq 0; X_t \notin I\}$ then \begin{equation*}
    \prob(\tau = \infty) \quad \text{iff} \quad v (l_+) = v(r_-) = \infty,
\end{equation*} otherwise the explosion time is finite $\prob(\tau = \infty) < 1$.

Optimal stopping problem, Tut9 Q3 or Tut 8 Q3, 



(Ornsteinâ€“Uhlenbeck process)
If $G$ function is deterministic (independent of $X$ process), the SDE can be reduced to ODE with finite variation. $0\leq t\leq T$, $A,B$ being matrix.
\begin{equation*}
    \begin{cases}
    \diff X_t = A X_t(t,X_t) \diff t + B \diff W_t,\\
    x_0= x \in \R^d &, W_t\in \R^d.
    \end{cases}
\end{equation*}

\begin{align*}
    X_t = x + \int_0^t A X_s \diff s+ B W_t \implies \frac{\diff Y_t}{\diff t} = x + A Y_t+ B W_t,
\end{align*} with $Y_t = \int_0^t X_s \diff s$ generates the solution.
\begin{equation*}
    Y_t = \int_0^t e^{(t-s)A} (x+ BW_s) \diff s.
\end{equation*}
Substitute back and use \ito formula, blablabla\footnote{See week6 lec1 40min}, at the end of the day you will find
\begin{equation*}
    X_t = e^{tA}x + \int_0^t e^{(t-s)A}B \diff W_s.
\end{equation*}
Then the directional derivative $\eta_t = e^{tA}$ is obvious. Moreover
\begin{equation*}
    X_t \sim N(e^{tA}x, \int_0^t e^{sA} BB^* e^{sA^*} \diff s).
\end{equation*}
If the covariance matrix has positive determinant, $X_t$ has density. And the covariance matrix can be calculated s.t.
\begin{align*}
    Q_t =& \E(X_t - e^{tA}x)(X_t - e^{tA})^*.
\end{align*}

\newpage
SDE problem

\begin{equation*}
    \diff X_t = -a X_t \diff t + \sigma \diff W_t.
\end{equation*}
Existence and uniqueness is immediate, both coefficients are lipschitz. Solution is again easy, this is \ref{example: OUprocess} process. See W9 Q4. and for time change please reference \ref{Thm: time_change}.

\vspace{2cm}
\begin{equation*}
    \diff X_t = X_t^2 \diff t + \sigma \diff W_t.
\end{equation*}
All polynomials are locally lipschitz, thus existence and uniqueness is guaranteed. See Week 10 Q2.

\vspace{2cm}
\textbf{If drift is linear, diffusion have following form}
\begin{equation*}
    \diff X_t = a X_t \diff t + \sigma \abs{X_t}^\alpha \diff W_t.
\end{equation*}
Existence and Uniqueness see W10 L1 page 10 Corollary.

\textbf{Vasicek's model}
\begin{equation*}
    \diff X_t = (b- a X_t) \diff t + \sigma \sqrt{X_t} \diff W_t.
\end{equation*}
Existence and Uniqueness is a special case of previous one. Further discussion at Tut10 Q3

\vspace{2cm}
\textbf{No drift}
\begin{equation*}
    \diff X_t = \sigma \sqrt{X_t} \diff W_t.
\end{equation*}

if diffusion is independent of $X_t$ then it is additive noise, see W6 L1 page 2 example
