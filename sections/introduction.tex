\section{Introduction \label{sec:intro}}
Quote from Dexter Chua "These notes are not endorsed by the lecturers, and I have modified them (often
significantly) after lectures. They are nowhere near accurate representations of what
was actually lectured, and in particular, all errors are almost surely mine"

% Lot of things comes with stochastic nature and we have models for them, for example in financial mathematics we have BSM Model (Black–Scholes–Merton Model).
